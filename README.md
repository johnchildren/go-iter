# go-iter
Generic iterators from go_generics

Just a little experiment inspired by https://github.com/scylladb/go-set for now.

Basically I just want to implement something very similar to Rust's Iterator trait which seems like it might
be possible with go_generics and generic interfaces. I'm not sure how ergonomic it will be to use though,
particularly when implementing Map and Filter equivilents.
